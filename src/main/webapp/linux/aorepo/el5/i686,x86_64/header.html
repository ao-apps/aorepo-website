<h1>AORepo / RHEL 5 or CentOS 5 (i686, x86_64) Production Repository</h1>
<p>
  This is a hybrid repository with both i686 and x86_64 support.  We maintain
  a transitional configuration of CentOS 5, which is based on the i686 architecture
  with 64-bit support layered on top.
</p>
<p>
  Most packages are released in both i686 and x86_64 forms.  The x86_64 packages
  can only run on 64-bit hardware, whereas the i686 packages can run on all servers.
</p>
<p>
  As all of our servers have been 64-bit for quite some time now, this is largely
  historical.  However, the 32-bit binaries can have an advantage in reduced memory
  consumption due to smaller pointers.
</p>
<p>
  Our later repositories, such as the <a href="../../el7/x86_64/">RHEL 7 or CentOS 7 (x86_64) Production Repository</a>,
  are all 64-bit only.
