<h1>AORepo Staging</h1>
<p>
  The repositories within this staging channel contain the sets of packages being built-up during the weekly
  update packaging phase.  The packages may have broken dependencies as we build
  new versions of packages and rebuild dependencies.
</p>
<p>
  This channel is only used by our template and build environments.
</p>
<p>
  Once all updates are packaged, the completed, coherent set of packages is
  promoted to the <a href="../testing/">testing channel</a>.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>This channel is not intended for general use.</strong>
  Please use the <a href="../aorepo/">production channel</a>,
  and optionally the <a href="../testing/">testing channel</a>.
</p>
