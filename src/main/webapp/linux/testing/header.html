<h1>AORepo Testing</h1>
<p>
	The repositories within this testing channel contain completed, coherent sets of packages currently being tested.
</p>
<p>
	This channel is expected to be enabled on development servers, which are
	updated first (round 1) in the weekly update cycle.
</p>
<p>
	The packages remain in testing until just before update round 2, at which
	time they are promoted to the <a href="../aorepo/">production channel</a>
	for use by production and premium servers in update rounds 2, 3, and 4.
